## Features

* Git Graph View:
    * Display:
        * Local & Remote Branches
        * Local Refs: Heads, Tags & Remotes
        * Uncommitted Changes
    * Perform Git Actions (available by right clicking on a commit / branch / tag):
        * Create, Checkout, Delete, Fetch, Merge, Pull, Push, Rebase, Rename & Reset Branches
        * Add, Delete & Push Tags
        * Checkout, Cherry Pick, Drop, Merge & Revert Commits
        * Clean, Reset & Stash Uncommitted Changes
        * Apply, Create Branch From, Drop & Pop Stashes
        * View annotated tag details (name, email, date and message)
        * Copy commit hashes, and branch, stash & tag names to the clipboard
    * View commit details and file changes by clicking on a commit. On the Commit Details View you can:
        * View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change by clicking on it.
        * Open the current version of any file that was affected in the commit.
        * Copy the path of any file that was affected in the commit to the clipboard.
        * Click on any HTTP/HTTPS url in the commit body to open it in your default web browser.
    * Compare any two commits by clicking on a commit, and then CTRL/CMD clicking on another commit. On the Commit Comparison View you can:
        * View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change between the selected commits by clicking on it.
        * Open the current version of any file that was affected between the selected commits.
        * Copy the path of any file that was affected between the selected commits to the clipboard.
    * Code Review - Keep track of which files you have reviewed in the Commit Details & Comparison Views.
        * Code Review's can be performed on any commit, or between any two commits (not on Uncommitted Changes).
        * When a Code Review is started, all files needing to be reviewed are bolded. When you view the diff / open a file, it will then be un-bolded.
        * Code Reviews persist across Visual Studio Code sessions. They are automatically closed after 90 days of inactivity.
    * View uncommitted changes, and compare the uncommitted changes with any commit.
    * Hover over any commit vertex on the graph to see a tooltip indicating:
        * Whether the commit is included in the HEAD.
        * Which branches, tags and stashes include the commit. 
    * Filter the branches shown in Git Graph using the 'Branches' dropdown menu. The options for filtering the branches are:
        * Show All branches
        * Select one or more branches to be viewed
        * Select from a user predefined array of custom glob patterns (by setting `git-graph.customBranchGlobPatterns`)
    * Fetch from Remote(s) _(available on the top control bar)_
    * Find Widget allows you to quickly find one or more commits containing a specific phrase (in the commit message / date / author / hash, branch or tag names).
    * Repository Settings Widget:
        * Allows you to view, add, edit, delete, fetch & prune remotes of the repository.
        * Configure "Issue Linking" - Converts issue numbers in commit messages into hyperlinks, that open the issue in your issue tracking system.
        * Configure "Pull Request Creation" - Automates the opening and pre-filling of a Pull Request form, directly from a branches context menu.
            * Support for the publicly hosted Bitbucket, GitHub and GitLab Pull Request providers is built-in.
            * Custom Pull Request providers can be configured using the Extension Setting `git-graph.customPullRequestProviders` (e.g. for use with privately hosted Pull Request providers). Information on how to configure custom providers is available [here](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph/wiki/Configuring-a-custom-Pull-Request-Provider).
        * Export your Git Graph Repository Configuration to a file that can be committed in the repository. It allows others working in the same repository to automatically use the same Git Graph configuration.
    * Keyboard Shortcuts (available in the Git Graph View):
        * `CTRL/CMD + F`: Open the Find Widget.
        * `CTRL/CMD + H`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to be centered on the commit referenced by HEAD.
        * `CTRL/CMD + R`: Refresh the Git Graph View.
        * `CTRL/CMD + S`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the first (or next) stash in the loaded commits.
        * `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + S`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the last (or previous) stash in the loaded commits.
        * When the Commit Details View is open on a commit:
            * `Up` / `Down`: The Commit Details View will be opened on the commit directly above or below it on the Git Graph View.
            * `CTRL/CMD + Up` / `CTRL/CMD + Down`: The Commit Details View will be opened on its child or parent commit on the same branch.
                * If the Shift Key is also pressed (i.e. `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Up` / `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Down`), when branches or merges are encountered the alternative branch is followed.
        * `Enter`: If a dialog is open, pressing enter submits the dialog, taking the primary (left) action.
        * `Escape`: Closes the active dialog, context menu or the Commit Details View.
    * Resize the width of each column, and show/hide the Date, Author & Commit columns.
    * Common Emoji Shortcodes are automatically replaced with the corresponding emoji in commit messages (including all [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)). Custom Emoji Shortcode mappings can be defined in `git-graph.customEmojiShortcodeMappings`.
* A broad range of configurable settings (e.g. graph style, branch colours, and more...). See the 'Extension Settings' section below for more information.
* "Git Graph" launch button in the Status Bar
* "Git Graph: View Git Graph" launch command in the Command Palette
