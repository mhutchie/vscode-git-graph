        * View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change by clicking on it in the Commit Details View.
    * Compare commits by clicking on a commit, and then CTRL/CMD clicking on another commit
        * View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change between the selected commits by clicking on the desired file in the Commit Details View.
    * View uncommitted changes, and compare the uncommitted changes with any commit.
    * Perform Git Actions (available by right clicking on a commit / branch / tag):
        * Create, Checkout, Rename, Delete, Merge, Push, Pull & Rebase branches
        * Add, Delete & Push tags
        * Checkout, Cherry Pick, Merge & Revert commits

    * Filter the branches shown in Git Graph using the 'Branches' dropdown menu. The options for filtering the branches are:
        * Show All branches
        * Select one or more branches to be viewed
        * Select from a user predefined array of custom glob patterns (by setting `git-graph.customBranchGlobPatterns`)
    * Fetch from Remote(s) _(available on the top control bar)_
    * Find widget allows you to quickly find one or more commits containing a specific phrase (in the commit message / date / author / hash, branch or tag names).
    * Keyboard Shortcuts:
        * Up / Down Arrows: When the Commit Details View is open, pressing the up and down arrow keys opens the previous or next commits' Commit Details View.
        * CTRL/CMD + f: Open the find widget.
        * CTRL/CMD + r: Refresh the Git Graph View.
        * Enter: If a dialog is open, pressing enter submits the dialog, taking the primary (left) action.
        * Escape: Closes the active dialog, context menu or the Commit Details View.
    * Resize the width of each column, and show/hide the Date, Author & Commit columns.
    * Common Emoji Shortcodes are automatically replaced with the corresponding emoji in commit messages (including all [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)). Custom Emoji Shortcode mappings can be defined in `git-graph.customEmojiShortcodeMappings`.
* A broad range of configurable settings (e.g. graph style, branch colours, and more...). See the 'Extension Settings' section below for more information.
* "Git Graph" launch button in the Status Bar
* "Git Graph: View Git Graph" launch command in the Command Palette

## Extension Settings

Detailed information of all Git Graph settings is available [here](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph/wiki/Extension-Settings), including: descriptions, screenshots, default values and types.

A summary of the Git Graph extension settings are:

* **Auto Center Commit Details View**: Automatically center the commit details view when it is opened.
* **Combine Local And Remote Branch Labels**: Combine local and remote branch labels if they refer to the same branch, and are on the same commit.
* **Commit Details View Location**: Specifies where the Commit Details View is rendered in the Git Graph view. Default: Inline (with graph)
* **Custom Branch Glob Patterns**: An array of Custom Glob Patterns to be shown in the 'Branches' dropdown. Example: `[{"name":"Feature Requests", "glob":"heads/feature/*"}]`
* **Custom Emoji Shortcode Mappings**: An array of custom Emoji Shortcode mappings. Example: `[{"shortcode": ":sparkles:", "emoji":"✨"}]`
* **Date Format**: Specifies the date format to be used in the date column of the graph.
* **Date Type**: Specifies the date type to be displayed throughout Git Graph, either the author or commit date.
* **Default Column Visibility**: An object specifying the default visibility of the Date, Author & Commit columns. Example: `{"Date": true, "Author": true, "Commit": true}`
* **Fetch Avatars**: Fetch avatars of commit authors and committers. Default: false (disabled)
* **Graph Colours**: Specifies the colours used on the graph.
* **Graph Style**: Specifies the style of the graph.
* **Initial Load Commits**: Specifies the number of commits to initially load.
* **Load More Commits**: Specifies the number of commits to load when the "Load More Commits" button is pressed (only shown when more commits are available).
* **Max Depth Of Repo Search**: Specifies the maximum depth of subfolders to search when discovering repositories in the workspace. Default: 0 (don't search subfolders)
* **Mute Merge Commits**: Show merge commits with a muted text colour. Default: true (enabled)
* **Open Diff Tab Location**: Specifies which pane the Visual Studio Code Diff is opened in. Default: Active
* **Open To The Repo Of The Active Text Editor Document**: Open Git Graph to the repository containing the active Text Editor document. Default: false (disabled)
* **Reference Label Alignment**: Specifies how branch and tag reference labels are aligned for each commit.
* **Retain Context When Hidden**: Specifies if the Git Graph view Visual Studio Code context is kept when the panel is no longer visible (e.g. moved to background tab). Enabling this setting will make Git Graph load significantly faster when switching back to the Git Graph tab, however has a higher memory overhead. Default: true (enabled)
* **Show Current Branch By Default**: Show the current branch by default when Git Graph is opened. Default: false (show all branches)
* **Show Status Bar Item**: Show a Status Bar item which opens Git Graph when clicked.
* **Show Uncommitted Changes**: Show uncommitted changes (set to false to decrease load time on large repositories).
