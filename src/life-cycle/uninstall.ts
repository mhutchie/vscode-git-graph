/**
 * Git Graph generates an event when it is installed, updated, or uninstalled, that is anonymous, non-personal, and cannot be correlated.
 * - Each event only contains the Git Graph and Visual Studio Code version numbers, and a 256 bit cryptographically strong pseudo-random nonce.
 * - The two version numbers recorded in these events only allow aggregate compatibility information to be generated (e.g. 50% of users are
 *   using Visual Studio Code >= 1.41.0). These insights enable Git Graph to utilise the latest features of Visual Studio Code as soon as
 *   the majority of users are using a compatible version. The data cannot, and will not, be used for any other purpose.
 * - Full details are available at: https://api.mhutchie.com/vscode-git-graph/about
